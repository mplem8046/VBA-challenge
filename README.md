# VBA-challenge

This is the homework submission for the VBA prtion of the Data Analytics course.
The primary goal was met. Bonus activity is a partial. I did not solve the greatest increase et al section, but
was able to get the multi-spreadsheet looping working.

Images of the results for each worksheet are uploaded as is a txt file
containing the VBA script.
